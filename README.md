# File Renaming Automation
Small script used to automate the renaming of Images by removing the 'IMG-' element for all the images in a specific folder

## How to use?
Download the file `script.py`

Place the file at the root of the folder that contains the folder containing all the images you want to modify.

Execute `python3 script.py`

The command line will ask you to input the name of the folder for which you want to change the name of the images:
`Folder Name: your_folder_name_here`

After executing the script, all your images will be renamed.
